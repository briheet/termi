# Termi

A terminal written in Rust.

From a very long time i have been wondering as to how do terminals work and programs do send requests.
After reading [wayland](https://way-cooler.org/book/wayland_introduction.html) i started thinking as to how would this work.
This is a project to learn while trying to build. Lets see how far this goes before i delete this in shame.
